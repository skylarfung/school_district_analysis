# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
Maria has given you data on all standardized test data for the city She want you to perform analysis on the data so that it can be used to inform disscusions and help make strategic decisions.

## Resources
- Data sources:
  - schools_complete.csv
  - students_complete.csv
- Software:
  - Python 3.7.6
 
 ## Summary
 Analysis of the data showed that:
 - Charter schools had a higher overall passing percentage thatn District schools
 - Large schools with 2000-5000 student did significatly worse in math than other schools
 - Schools that spent less money per student recieved better overall passing percentages
 - Cabrera High School had the highest passing percentage at 91.33%
 - Rodriguez High School had the lowest passing percentage at 52.98%

## Challenge Overview
It was discovered that the grades of the 9th graders at Thomas High School have been changed. You must replace the math and reading scores from Thomas High School with "NaN" while leaving the rest of the data unchanged.

## Challenge Summary
The change of the data does not effect the analysis as much. Since the data was changed to "NaN", the data now has no effect on the analysis. This further reduces the population size, but does not effect the overall analysis.
